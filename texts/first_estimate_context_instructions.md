We will ask you to make a set of forecasts based on real data. Weâ€™ll show you a graph. Enter a prediction for Y (vertical axis) at a specified value of X (horizontal axis).  Finally, put a 95% confidence interval around your prediction of Y. Give upper and lower bounds that represent an interval such that you are 95% confident the actual number falls inside. Please do not use any outside sources! Base your answers on the data provided. 

This is a difficult task, so thank you for doing your best and staying focused!
