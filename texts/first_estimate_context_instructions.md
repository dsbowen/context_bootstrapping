We will now show you graphs that display a variety of data-sets. And we will ask you to make estimates of what is likely to happen next.

For example, we might show a graph of how the temperature in New York changes between, say, January and July 2020. And we'd then ask you to predict what will happen after the graph stops and fill in temperature values for the next six months through December 2020.

Because we're interested in how your thinking does or doesn't change over time, we'll ask you to make two estimates for each graph.

We will pay you a larger bonus if your estimates are more accurate. Please do not look up the answers.
