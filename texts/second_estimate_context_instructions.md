We will now ask you to make a second estimate for each graph.

When making your second estimates, we want you to imagine that you do not know what the numbers represent and make your jdugments purely on the basis of the patterns of numbers on the time line. Try to find things you overlooked and be sure that your second estimate is at least somewhat different from your first.
