We will now show you graphs that display a variety of data-sets. And we will ask you to make estimates of what is likely to happen next.

At this point in the experiment, we are asking you to make your estimates before you know anything about what the numbers represent. We will simply show you a series of "Untitled Graphs". Our goal is to assess how well people can make predictions purely from the patterns of numbers over time.
