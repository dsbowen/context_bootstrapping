We will ask you to make a set of forecasts based on real data although we will not tell you what the data are. Weâ€™ll show you a graph. Enter a prediction for Y (VERTICAL axis) at a specified value of X (HORIZONTAL axis).  Finally, put a 95% confidence interval around your prediction of Y. Give upper and lower bounds that represent an interval such that you are 95% confident the actual number falls inside. Base your answers on the data provided. 

This is a difficult task, so thank you for doing your best and hanging in there!
